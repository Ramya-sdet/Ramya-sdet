# Hello! I'm Ramya 🚀 

### 💡 Aspiring SDET | Logic Explorer
I’m a code-enthusiast who looks at a "Submit" button and wonders,
*"What happens if I click this ten times in a second?"* I am deeply passionate about the art of **Software Testing**.
While others focus solely on building features, I focus on making those features **invincible**. 
I love the puzzle of finding edge cases and the satisfaction of writing a script that catches a mistake.

### 🧩 My Journey into Quality
I am currently immersed in mastering the foundations of automated testing. I don't just want to find bugs; 
I want to understand the **logic** that created them.

* **🔍 Exploration:** Learning how to navigate the DOM and interact with elements like a pro.
* **✍️ Scripting:** Writing clean, readable code in Java to simulate user behavior.
* **📐 Precision:** Learning how to write assertions that actually mean something.
* **🛠️ Tooling:** Getting hands-on with **Selenium**  to bring automation to life.

### 🛠️ What I'm Learning & Using
* **Language:**  Java (The backbone of my logic)
* **Web Testing:** Selenium WebDriver (Turning manual steps into automated magic)
* **Framework Basics:** Organizing my code using TestNG patterns.
* **Version Control:** Git (Keeping my experiments safe and organized)

### 🌟 Why I Love Testing
1. **The "Gotcha" Moment:** There is no better feeling than finding an edge case that no one else saw.
2. **Clean Code:** I believe a test suite should be as beautiful and organized as the app itself.
3. **User Advocacy:** I represent the user. If it's broken for them, it's my job to find it first.

### 📈 What's happening in my Labs...
- 🏗️ Building a **"Project-A-Day"** habit to sharpen my automation scripts.
- 📖 Deep-diving into **Object-Oriented Programming** to build better test structures.
- 🧪 Practicing on "Broken" sites to improve my debugging skills.
- - 🧪 Experimenting with **API endpoints** to understand data integrity.
- 📚 Researching how **AI models** can be validated for bias and accuracy.
